An interactive teaching tool that demonstrates the Gr. 11 Physics concept of Frequency Beats through a user-determined sound app, interactive quiz, and investigations! Independent final project for Grade 11 Computer Science during E-Learn Summer School.

The program is intuitive and requires a mouse, keyboard, and speakers, as well as a .jar reader.

Double click "Pitch_Your_Best_Beat.jar" to initialize the app.

Access different content through the main tabs, and for the lesson, access sub-topics through the sub-tabs.

PROGRAM OVERVIEW
------------------------------------------
INTRODUCTION
- Introduces the application, with a diagram of harmonic frequencies.
- Provides feedback information

LESSON 
(Access through subtabs)
1. Review
- Wave interference 
- Constructive/Destructive Interference w/ diagrams
- Real-life examples
2. Content
- Overview of beat frequencies (max. 2 frequencies at the 11U level).
- Detailed explanation of beat frequencies, with formula for two frequencies.
- Identification strategies for beat frequencies (acoustic/vestibular).
- Consequences of certain beat frequencies.
3. Application
- Useful applications in real life, esp. music.
- Concept of "missing fundamental"
- Video link to guitar demonstration.
- E.g. tuning, harmony. Perfect fifths. 

INVESTIGATION
1. Standard Frequency (440Hz - default)
- Press "Play" radio button to initialize the reference frequency.
- Press "Stop" radio button to stop the reference frequency. (Currently non-functional - ref. frequency stops after ~15 seconds)
2. Input Frequency (user-determined)
- Input desired frequency (+/- integer; no decimals) in the text field.
- Press "Play" radio button after inputting the desired frequency to initialize the user-frequency.
- Press "Stop" radio button to stop the user-frequency. (Currently non-functional - user frequency automatically stops after ~5 seconds)
3. Log Button
- After inputting a frequency, press the log button to keep track of tested frequencies and their beats.
- Displays the beat frequency, calculated as fb = |f2âˆ’f1|, where fb is the beat frequency, f2 is the input frequency, and f1 is the standard frequency. 
- Pro tip: Start with input 0Hz, then press the log button. Take the calculated beat frequency (440Hz) and log it. Continue doing the same to the next beat frequency. The beat frequency, when entered subsequently, produces the harmonic series for A! Try it out yourself!
- NOTE: although the beat frequency is calculated for negative inputs, note that these are theoretical beat frequencies. 

QUIZ
1. (3) fill-in-the-blank questions, (2) multiple choice questions.
2. "Submit" buttton calculates score, and displays if any questions were left empty.
