An interactive teaching tool that demonstrates the Gr. 11 Physics concept of Frequency Beats through a user-determined sound app, interactive quiz, and investigations!

The program is intuitive and requires a mouse, keyboard, and speakers, as well as a .jar reader.

Double click "Pitch_Your_Best_Beat.jar" to initialize the app.

Access different content through the main tabs, and for the lesson, access sub-topics through the sub-tabs.

PROGRAM OVERVIEW
------------------------------------------
INTRODUCTION
- Introduces the application, with a diagram of harmonic frequencies.
- Provides feedback information

LESSON 
(Access through subtabs)
1. Review
- Wave interference 
- Constructive/Destructive Interference w/ diagrams
- Real-life examples
2. Content
- Overview of beat frequencies (max. 2 frequencies at the 11U level).
- Detailed explanation of beat frequencies, with formula for two frequencies.
- Identification strategies for beat frequencies (acoustic/vestibular).
- Consequences of certain beat frequencies.
3. Application
- Useful applications in real life, esp. music.
- Concept of "missing fundamental"
- Video link to guitar demonstration.
- E.g. tuning, harmony. Perfect fifths. 

INVESTIGATION
1. Standard Frequency (440Hz - default)
- Press "Play" radio button to initialize the reference frequency.
- Press "Stop" radio button to stop the reference frequency. (Currently non-functional - ref. frequency stops after a few seconds.)
2. Input Frequency (user-input)
- Input desired frequency (+/- Integer; no decimals) in the text field.
- Press "Play" radio button after inputting the desired frequency to initialize the user-frequency.
- Press "Stop" radio button to stop the user-frequency. (Currently non-functional - user frequency automatically stops after a few seconds.)
